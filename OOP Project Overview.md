# 🧠 Monster Brawl Project Summary

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to:

1. **Abstraction**  
   - Define an abstract `CharacterCard` class to capture shared state and behavior shared by all characters (e.g., HP, attack range, special abilities).

2. **Encapsulation**  
   - Protect internal state (`currentHealth`) by using private/protected fields and exposing public methods like `takeDamage()` and `heal()`.

3. **Inheritance**  
   - Create `HeroCard` and `MonsterCard` classes that inherit from `CharacterCard`, adding specific features like special abilities.

4. **Polymorphism & Composition**  
   - Use an `Effect` interface and compose different effects (e.g. `DamageEffect`, `HealEffect`) into reusable `SpecialAbility` instances that behave differently depending on the card using them.

5. **TypeScript Interfaces & Typing**  
   - Define interfaces for incoming data (e.g., card JSON) and use types consistently across functions and constructors.

6. **React-Bootstrap Layout**  
   - Use a 12-column grid system and utility classes (like `mx-auto`, `p-2`, etc.) to layout the game board and cards using components like `<Row>`, `<Col>`, and pre-built card UIs.

## 📜 Game Rules

> _(This is the same version stored in the canvas under “Monster Brawl Rules”)_

### 🛠 Components

1. **Hero Deck** (10 cards)
   - `name`
   - `maxHealth` (e.g. 20)
   - `attackRange` (e.g. 4–12)
   - `specialAbilities: [SpecialAbility, SpecialAbility]`

2. **Monster Deck**
   - `name`
   - `maxHealth` (e.g. 15–25)
   - `attackRange` (e.g. 3–10)
   - `specialAbilities: [SpecialAbility, SpecialAbility]`

3. **Hero Action Deck** (unique per hero)
   - **Basic Attack** cards
   - **Use Special 1** cards
   - **Use Special 2** cards
   - (Optional additional actions like "Heal 4 HP")

4. **Monster Action Deck**
   - Basic Attack
   - Use Special 1 / Use Special 2
   - Double Attack
   - Defend (halve next incoming damage)
   - Debuff (e.g., ignore hero specials next turn)

---

### 🏁 Setup

1. Shuffle Hero Deck and Monster Deck.
2. Draw 3 heroes, pick 1, discard the others.
3. Draw 1 monster.
4. Shuffle the selected hero's Action Deck and the Monster Action Deck.
5. Set both hero and monster to full HP.

---

### 🔄 Turn Structure

**Hero Turn**
1. Draw 3 cards from the Action Deck.
2. Pick 1 to play. Resolve it immediately.
   - Basic Attack: roll 0—max of attack range. 0 = miss.
   - Use Special 1 or 2: execute the respective special ability.
   - Any other card: resolve effect.
3. Discard the other 2 cards.

**Monster Turn**
1. Draw 1 card from the Monster Action Deck.
2. Resolve its effect.

Repeat until one side's HP ≤ 0.

---

### 🎯 Victory Conditions

- Hero wins if the monster's HP ≤ 0.
- Monster wins if the hero's HP ≤ 0.

## 🧙 Hero Roster (Character Names Only)

These are the 9 heroes currently planned:

- Fighter  
- Paladin  
- Healer  
- Mage  
- Rogue  
- Archer  
- Barbarian  
- Monk  
- Necromancer

> Max HP, attack ranges, and special ability details will be completed later.

## 💥 Special Ability Design Criteria

Special abilities must:
- Be **resolved immediately** during the turn they are played (no status effects or lingering effects).
- Use one of the following types of action:
  - **Flat damage** (e.g. “Deal 6 damage”)
  - **Random damage roll** (e.g. “Roll 0–8 and deal that much damage”)
  - **Multiple basic attacks** (e.g. “Roll basic attack twice”)
  - **Chance-based effects** (e.g. 70% chance of high damage, 30% miss)
  - **Healing** (either fixed amount or random roll)
  - **Combined effects** (e.g. “Deal 4 damage and heal 4 HP”)

Specials should encourage different playstyles without being overly complex to code.

## 🧩 Project Pacing & Pedagogical Flow

Each task in the project is scaffolded to introduce only what students need at that moment. Here’s the flow:

1. **Start with TypeScript basics** (variables, typed functions).
2. **Introduce classes through abstraction and encapsulation** (CharacterCard).
3. **Add inheritance** (HeroCard, MonsterCard).
4. **Introduce interfaces and composition** with effects and special abilities.
5. **Practice constructors and syntax** through manual monster instantiation.
6. **Use factories for the hero and action decks**.
7. **Build out the game engine** as a console loop first (simple logic).
8. **Scaffold the UI** using React-Bootstrap with pre-built components.
9. **Connect the UI to the logic**.
10. **Polish layout using mockups**.

Each task is written with built-in instructional content, not just requirements.
